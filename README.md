Anteater Dynamics 7DOF Robot Blog
Welcome to our GitHub Page! We are a team of six undergraduate engineers working with our industry sponsor ROBOTIS to develop a 
7-degree-of-freedom robotic arm to be used by robotics enthusiasts and to help in data collection to be used to 
further develop robotics systems. This page will document our team's progress throughout the lifespan of our project
and will include any files, simulations, documents, or other relevant information pertaining to our project.
